Online devops meetups. This is for events like [CoffeeOps](https://www.coffeeops.org/) or similar community-driven events. If your event charges for attendance, it doesn't belong here.

I'm organizing these by time zone, but am open to better suggestions.

## US time zone events

### CoffeeOps online

#### Denver

This takes place on Thursday mornings at 8am MDT (1400 in the one true time zone, UTC). Details are posted in `#coffeeops-online` on the [hangops slack](https://hangops.slack.com/) and in `#remote` in the [coffeeops slack](https://coffeeops.slack.com). This is an informal free-for-all about technology, coping with suddenly being remote, and at least partially an excuse to be social.

# Organizer tips

The Kubernetes project has a good set of [organizer guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/zoom-guidelines.md). They're using Zoom, but there's a lot of good generic information there as well.
